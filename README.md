Java TestSmells Detection

JNose Test is a tool developed to automatically detect test smells in test code, and to collect coverage metrics. JNose test is an extension of the Test Smell Detector. Besides presenting the number of test smells detected by class, our tool shows the collection of code metrics and test coverage using the JaCoCo library; a unified result for all projects under analysis; and a graphical interface. In addition, the project uses the Apache Maven to manage all library dependencies and support the compilation and execution of the JNose Test tool.
